Just something I’ve noted down months ago, almost forgot that I intended to dive into later.

* [Node.js](http://cappuccino.org/): server-side javascript - http://nodejs.org
* [Cappuchino](http://cappuccino.org/): Objective-J, building web-apps that look & feel like desktop apps
* [Brunch](http://brunchwithcoffee.com/): A lightweight approach to building HTML5 applications with emphasis on elegance and simplicity
* [Lessframework](http://lessframework.com/): Less Framework is a CSS grid system for designing adaptive web­sites.
* [Radi](http://radiapp.com): doing animation, effects,... the HTML5 way (no Flash!)
* [Website Tour with jQuery](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2010/12/21/website-tour/): a little script that allows to create a tour on a website with jQuery.
