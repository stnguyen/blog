Hello world! :)

My name is <strong>Nguyen Son Tung</strong>... yeah, I know, you have problem pronounce it, so just call me  <strong>Stefan Nguyen</strong> for everyone's sakes.

I'm a young, enthusiastic developer living in <a title="Hoan Kiem Lake, Ha Noi" href="http://g.co/maps/9n3fm" target="_blank">Ha Noi, Viet Nam</a>.

I enjoys my life hacking around with Web development and making fun of creating Mobile apps. I love building applications which help people with real-world problems, no matter how big or small. I builds things which just work, and are enjoyable to work with, no bullshits!

You can find open-source projects I am/were working on in <a title="sontung23 @ github.com" href="https://github.com/stnguyen" target="_blank">my github page</a>, not a lot for now, and most of them are Ruby on Rails related. Yes, I love <strong>RoR</strong> when it comes to <strong>web development</strong>; for <strong>mobile apps</strong>, I like building them using either native, cross-platform or hybrid way.

I'm currently working at <a title="Vinova Pte Ltd" href="http://vinova.sg" target="_blank">Vinova Pte Ltd</a>, a small company located in Singapore specialized in Web/Mobile app development. Our base-camp in Ha Noi provides a great environment for youths fascinated in software development, so if YOU are so crazy about creating Web/Mobile apps, you have an idea, or want to take a good job, don't hesitate to <a title="Contact Vinova" href="http://vinova.sg/contact" target="_blank">contact us</a>.

Thank you and have a great day!
